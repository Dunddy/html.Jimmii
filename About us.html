    <h1>One Happy Family </h1>

    <h5>Originally from Nigeria, we hail from different regions of the country and hence come from different tribes, backgrounds and culture. Our family is a diversified one and we thrive from this virtue.</h5>

    <h5>We are in Kitchener Ontario as Permanent Residents and by 2026 hope to become citizens as our lovely daughter</h5>
